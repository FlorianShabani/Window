# Window-
The Window library used by most of my programs. It starts  JFrame and JPanel which redraws a specified times in a second and also calles the tick(update) method similarly.
Every main class implements Manager(or extends ManagerA), then I start a new Window in the main function and pass the controll class as argumend and  also the framerate/tickrate/Width/Height/Name.
